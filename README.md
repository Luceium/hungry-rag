# Hungry RAG

This is a project assigned for an in class hackathon.
This project is intended to implement: an LLM enhanced by RAG, a cache, and a UI
We are using Vectara to handle the complete RAG pipeline
We use Next.js, Daisy UI, Tailwind, and Aceternity UI to design the interface.
Lastly, we use redis to handle caching of questions.
